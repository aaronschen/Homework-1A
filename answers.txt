What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
What the git rebase command does is that it integrates changes from one branch into another by replaying all of the commits from the old branch into the new branch, in the process rewriting the commit history of the original branch. When the git rebase command is run, the branch that it is called on changes its base from one commit to another, making it seem like the branch was created from that commit. What the git merge command does is that it merges changes from two separate branches into one, finding a common base commit between them and then creating a new merge commit that combines the changes. When the git merge command is run, the changes from the specified branch are merged onto the branch that the user is currently on. To summarize the main differences, git rebase creates a new set of commits that are applied to the target branch, while git merge creates a new merge commit that combines the changes from both branches. Rebasing creates a linear branch structure while merging creates a chain-like branch structure.
